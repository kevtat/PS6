# For my project, I used the world population dataset where it displays each individual countrie's 2022 population and their respective growth rates. The graph shows the least populated countires in each individual continent. So you can select Asia for example and it will show the least populated countries. In the third tab, it renders a data table that shows each individul countrie's growth rate and 2022 population. The user can select a continent and it will show the group of countries in that continent. The side panel also calculates the average growth rate for the continent that the user selects.
